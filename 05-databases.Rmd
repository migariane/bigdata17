# Databases {#databases}

## Overview
  A database is simply an organized structure for storing and accessing data on disk. There are a number of structures used to store data on disk, each with their own languages.  
  


## Relational Databases (SQL)

A Relational Database stores information in a the form of entities and the relationships between them. Entities are typically nouns and relationships are typically verbs. For example, if we wanted to store information about class enrollment at a university, the entities would consist of objects like a student, class, and professor. The relationships would consist of takes and teaches. Relationships can be one to one, many to many, or one to many.

### SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard way that information stored in relational databases is queried. There are a number of variations on the language, and a number of online resources available for learning their various complexities. However, the general structure of all SQL queries is consistent across implementations. 

In SQL systems, entities and relationships are represented by tables, where each row or record in a table represents a particular instance of of that general object. Continuing the class example, students would be stored in `Student`, classes in `Class`, and professors in `Professor`. The table containing the relationships between students and classes would be likely named `StudentClass` and the 

The three key parts of a SQL query are the `SELECT` clause, the `FROM` clause, and the `WHERE` clause. The `SELECT` clause specifies the pieces of information you want about an individual record, the `FROM` clause specifies the tables that will be used


To get all information about all students we would type the following:
```{SQL} 
SELECT * FROM STUDENT
``` 

To Select the name and birthday of all students in classes taught by Dr. Choirat would be a more complex query, which would likely look something like this:

```{SQL}
   SELECT Name,
          DOB
   FROM Student s 
        inner join StudentClass sc on 
            s.ID = sc.studentid
        inner join ProfessorClass pc on
            sc.classid = pc.classid
        inner join Professor p on
            pc.profid = p.id
    WHERE p.lastname = "Choirat"
    ```

### SQL and R



## Non-Relational Databases (noSQL)

NoSQL Databases were developed to solve some of the limitations that can come with SQL databases.

### Common Types of NoSQL Databases

#### Graph Databases

#### Object Databases

## R interfaces
